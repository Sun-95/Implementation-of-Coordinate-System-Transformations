Define the coordinates of several points in the polar coordinate system.
Convert these coordinates to the Cartesian coordinate system.
Perform the reverse conversion from the Cartesian coordinate system to the polar coordinate system.
Verify the correctness of the calculations by ensuring that the initial coordinates match the ones obtained after the reverse conversion.

Three-Dimensional Space: Cartesian and Spherical Coordinate Systems

Define the coordinates of several points in the spherical coordinate system.
Convert these coordinates to the Cartesian coordinate system.
Perform the reverse conversion from the Cartesian coordinate system to the spherical coordinate system.
Verify the correctness of the calculations by ensuring that the initial coordinates match the ones obtained after the reverse conversion.

Distance Calculation in the Spherical Coordinate System:

Compute the distance between points in the spherical coordinate system using two methods:

Cartesian Coordinate System: Use the standard formula for calculating straight-line distance in two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces.
Polar Coordinate System: Use the formula for calculating the distance between points in a two-dimensional space.
Spherical Coordinate System: Compute the distance between points using two methods:
Through the volume of the sphere: Use the formula for straight-line distance in three-dimensional space.
Along the surface of the sphere: Use the formula for great-circle distance.

Performance Benchmarks:

Generate an array of coordinate pairs in each coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, spherical).
Compute the distances between these points for each coordinate system.
Measure the computation time for each coordinate system.
Choose an array size that results in minimal variability in benchmarking results between runs (a recommended array size is 10,000 to 100,000 points).
Report Requirements
Describe the process of transitioning between coordinate systems and the results of checking calculation accuracy.
Present benchmarking results in the form of tables or graphs, indicating the time required for distance calculations in each coordinate system.
Draw conclusions regarding the efficiency of using each coordinate system for distance calculations.
Recommendations
Use any programming language or development environment that you are comfortable with (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++).
Pay attention to code optimization for benchmarking to reduce variability in the results.
Evaluation Criteria
The quality and validity of conclusions based on benchmarking results.
The quality of the report presentation.
