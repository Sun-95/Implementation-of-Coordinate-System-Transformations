Performance Benchmarks:

Generate an array of coordinate pairs in each coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, spherical).
Compute the distances between these points for each coordinate system.
Measure the computation time for each coordinate system.
Choose an array size that results in minimal variability in benchmarking results between runs (a recommended array size is 10,000 to 100,000 points).
Report Requirements
Describe the process of transitioning between coordinate systems and the results of checking calculation accuracy.
Present benchmarking results in the form of tables or graphs, indicating the time required for distance calculations in each coordinate system.
Draw conclusions regarding the efficiency of using each coordinate system for distance calculations.
Recommendations
Use any programming language or development environment that you are comfortable with (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++).
Pay attention to code optimization for benchmarking to reduce variability in the results.
Evaluation Criteria
The quality and validity of conclusions based on benchmarking results.
The quality of the report presentation.
